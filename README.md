**Volatility Forecasting Challenge**

Volatility forecasting is a critical aspect of risk management and trading strategies. In this problem statement, we challenge you to develop a comprehensive trading strategy that leverages volatility predictions for selected stocks. You are free to choose the modelling technique that best suits your approach.

**Problem Description:** Build a Volatility Forecasting Model: Develop a model in Python for forecasting the future volatility of stocks. You can choose the modelling technique that aligns with your strategy - Utilise historical daily stock price data for the top 20 stocks by market capitalisation on the NSE.

**Volatility Forecasting:** Implement your chosen model to predict future volatility for each selected stock. Your model should provide a reliable volatility estimate over a rational forecast horizon.

**Trading Strategy:** Formulate a trading strategy based on the predicted volatility. Your strategy should capitalise on changes in volatility, adjusting positions accordingly. Ensure that the strategy is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

**Backtesting:** Backtest your trading strategy using historical data from August 2018 to August 2023. Evaluate its performance against the selected stocks, considering transaction costs and other relevant factors.

**Visualisations and Results:** Generate visualisations to illustrate the predicted volatility, trading signals, and the performance of your strategy. Present your results clearly and concisely in the Python Notebook.
